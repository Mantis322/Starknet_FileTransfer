# Secure P2P File Transfer on Starknet 🔐

A revolutionary decentralized file sharing application built on Starknet that combines the power of P2P connections with blockchain security.

## Why This Matters? 🤔

Traditional file sharing solutions face numerous challenges in today's digital landscape. Here's how our solution compares:


| Feature | Traditional File Sharing | Centralized Blockchain Solutions | P2P Starknet File Transfer |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Server Costs | High maintenance costs | Medium-high gas fees | Minimal (only for permissions) |
| Data Storage | Centralized servers | On-chain (expensive) | P2P (no storage costs) |
| Security | Vulnerable to server attacks | Smart contract dependent | Dual-layer (P2P + Blockchain) |
| Privacy | Limited by server policies | Public blockchain data | Private P2P connections |
| Access Control | Database-dependent | Smart contract-based | Smart contract + Security code |
| Scalability | Server-limited | Blockchain-limited | P2P network scalability |
| Single Point of Failure | Yes (central server) | No | No |
| Cost for Users | Subscription/Storage fees | High gas fees | Minimal gas fees |
